# termination script

## Introduction
I wrote this script and powershell module for a previous employer to completely automate process that is normally performed on a user's profile when they leave the company.  This script utlizes and manipulates the following technologies:

* Office 365
* Microsoft Azure
* Active Directory
* Box Cloud Storage

**IMPORTANT**  Please be aware that this was written to be used in a specific environment.  I do not advise that anyone run the script outside it's intended environment.

The script allows the user to search active directory for the user account that should be processed using the same dialog box that the Active Directory Users and Computers MMC snap in uses.
